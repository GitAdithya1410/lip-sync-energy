# lip-sync-energy
A Python application that performs automatic cartoon lip-syncing using audio analysis, dynamic mouth-shape switching, and alpha-blended character rendering.
This system takes:
	• A cartoon character
	• A set of phoneme-based mouth PNGs
	• Any speech audio
	• An optional background image
	
This outputs a lip-synced animation video.

Built with OpenCV, Librosa, MoviePy, and ONNX-based background removal.
